<h2 class="h3 col-10 mx4 pt3" id="https-protects-website-integrity">HTTPS Protects Website Integrity</h2>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">HTTPS helps prevent intruders from changing content and communication between your website and your users' browsers. Intruders are composed of several types; malicious attackers, legitimate yet intrusive companies like Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or hotels and free wi-fi services that inject ads into pages.</p>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">These intruders exploit insecure communications and can trick your users into providing them sensitive information and/or having them install malware! Other intruders will inject their own advertisements into your content. In fact, some intruders inject advertisements into websites that can break user experiences while creating security holes.</p>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">Every piece of unprotected content traveling between your website and your users is a potential exploit opportunity for intruders.  This includes all images, scripts, cookies, HTML, CSS … all of these elements are exploitable by intruders. Worse yet, these intrusions are possible at any point in the network, such as a user’s device, Wi-Fi hotspots, or a compromised ISP, as a few examples.</p>

<h2 class="h3 col-10 mx4 pt3" id="https-protects-security-and-privacy-of-users">HTTPS protects security and privacy of users</h2>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">HTTPS secure website connections deny intruders the ability to passively listen, watch, learn or decipher communications between your website and your users.</p>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">It's a common misconception that HTTPS is only needed for websites or pages that ask users for personal information. All insecure HTTP requests allow for the possibility of information regarding behavior and identity of your users being exposed. A single visit to an insecure website may seem harmless but some intruders evaluate the aggregate activities of user browsing making inferences about behaviors & intentions, helping de-anonymize user identities! Do employees within a company want to unintentionally provide sensitive health issues about themselves to their employers by browsing insecure medical articles?</p>

<h3 class="h4 col-10 mx4 pt3">Every Website Should Be Secure!</h3> 

<h2 class="h3 col-10 mx4 pt3" id="the-future-of-the-web-is-https">The Future of the Web is HTTPS</h2>

<p class="col-10 mx4 pb1 pt1">The web today is much different than the web of yesterday, and it's continually evolving. There are now websites that leverage the latest web standards and web technologies, such as Service Workers and Progressive Web Apps, that bring desktop and mobile app function to users right within the web browser.  These new web standards and web technologies require use of HTTPS globally <em>(entirely secure website)</em> to allow them to do things like take photos, provide location information <em>(old ways of doing geolocation are depreciated and will discontinue working without updates and HTTPS protocol)</em>, install an app icon to users homescreens, subscribing to push notifications, recording audio and allowing the website to be used offline - just to name a few!  To learn more about the latest web standards, visit <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. To learn about some of the new and exciting things that websites are doing today, check out <a href="/progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps</a>, the future of the web; today! </p>
