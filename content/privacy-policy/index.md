<h2 class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Security </h2>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Wherever we collect information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.  In fact, we’ve made our entire site accessible ONLY through “https”, the secure protocol.</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">  
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
<h2 class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Links </h2>

<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site.
