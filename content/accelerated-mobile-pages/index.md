<h2 class="h3 col-10 mx4 pb3 pt3">Why consider an AMP website?</h2>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">53% of users abandon websites that do not load in 3 seconds or less on mobile networks. [<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps#fast"> Source</a>]</p>
<p class="col-10 mx3 pb1 pt1">Since the average mobile website takes on average 19 seconds to render on mobile networks, <strong>most websites lose over half their potential viewers due to slow website speeds</strong>.</p>
